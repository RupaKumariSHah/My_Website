    How do I decide what to put in a paragraph? Before you can begin to
    determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must
    first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper.
    What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your
    reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In
    other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a
    recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each
    paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and
    your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic oneâ€”a natural
    progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct,
    familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.
